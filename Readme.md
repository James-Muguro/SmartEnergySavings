## Purpose of the Model
This model is designed to evaluate the feasibility of integrating a battery system into an existing solar electricity generation setup. The goal is to provide valuable insights into potential cost savings and the financial viability of such an installation.

## Data Checks and Results
The dataset undergoes rigorous checks to ensure data completeness and reliability. The following steps are performed:

1. **Verification of Data Completeness:**
   - Ensure all necessary fields are populated.
   - Handle missing values appropriately.

2. **Outlier Investigation:**
   - Identify and address outliers using boxplots.

## Assumptions
The model operates under the following assumptions:

- **Electricity Cost:** The cost of electricity per kWh is assumed to be $0.17.
- **Battery Charge Level:** The maximum battery charge level is set at 100 kWh.

## Data Understanding
To gain a comprehensive understanding of the dataset, we undertake the following:

1. **Data Types and Distributions:**
   - Explore data types and distributions for effective analysis.

2. **Visualization:**
   - Utilize time-series line plots and histograms for visualization.

## Modeling Steps and Checks
The model follows a systematic approach with clear steps and checks:

1. **Average Solar Electricity Generation and Electricity Usage per Hour:**
   - Calculate and visualize hourly averages.

2. **Outlier Investigation:**
   - Utilize boxplots to identify and address outliers.

3. **Electricity Bought and Excess Solar Electricity Generated:**
   - Calculate hourly electricity bought and excess solar electricity generated.

4. **Cumulative Battery Charge Modeling:**
   - Model the cumulative charge level of the battery over time.

5. **Electricity Bought with Battery Installed:**
   - Calculate electricity bought when a battery is installed.

6. **Savings Calculation:**
   - Determine the savings from installing a battery.

7. **Monthly Tabulation and Charting:**
   - Tabulate and visualize monthly solar generation, electricity usage, and purchased electricity.

## Long-Term Projections
To project future savings, we consider two scenarios of electricity price changes over 20 years.

## Further Checks
- **Internal Rate of Return (IRR) Calculation:**
  - Calculate IRR for different scenarios.

- **Additional Metrics:**
  - Evaluate extra electricity met, implied savings, electricity price with inflation, NPV, and IRR.

## Conclusion
The documentation provides a detailed account of the model's steps, checks, and assumptions. It is structured logically for easy comprehension by both fellow and senior analysts. The model aims to offer valuable insights into the financial implications of integrating a battery into solar electricity generation.
